## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}
mtcars

```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
install.packages("kableExtra")
library(kableExtra)
```

```{r}
mean_disp <- mtcars %>%
  group_by(cyl) %>%
  summarise(mean_disp = mean(disp, na.rm = TRUE))
mean_disp %>%
  kable(col.names = c("Cylinders", "Mean Displacement"), format = "html") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"))
```
